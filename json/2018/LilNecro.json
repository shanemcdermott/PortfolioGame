As one of two programmers in the group, I primarily focused on our game's architecture.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Mark, our lead designer, wasn't familiar with Unity. To address this, I created a small framework to import his designs from a JSON format. This was used to assign each level's dialogue options, victory conditions, and transition links. This allowed us to both realize (most of) Mark's designs within a 48 hour window as well as opened the game up to user modifications.</p>"
